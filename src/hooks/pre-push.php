 *
 * This hook is called by git push and can be used to prevent a push from taking place.
 * The hook is called with two parameters which provide the name and location of the
 * destination remote, if a named remote is not being used both values will be the same.
 *
 * Information about what is to be pushed is provided on the hookâ€™s standard input
 * with lines of the form:
 *
 * <local ref> SP <local sha1> SP <remote ref> SP <remote sha1> LF
 *
 * For instance, if the command git push origin master:foreign were run the hook
 * would receive a line like the following:
 *
 * refs/heads/master 67890 refs/heads/foreign 12345
 *
 * although the full, 40-character SHA-1s would be supplied. If the foreign ref does
 * not yet exist the <remote SHA-1> will be 40 0. If a ref is to be deleted,
 * the <local ref> will be supplied as (delete) and the <local SHA-1> will be 40 0.
 * If the local commit was specified by something other than a name which could be
 * expanded (such as HEAD~, or a SHA-1) it will be supplied as it was originally given.
 *
 * If this hook exits with a non-zero status, git push will abort without
 * pushing anything. Information about why the push is rejected may be sent to the
 * user by writing to standard error.
